    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a good basic recipe for a side dish for Chinese BBQ pork. Add or subtract any vegetables of your choice. As a main course, try adding cooked shrimp, chicken, or pork. Always prep and measure all ingredients before you start to cook! Serve with egg drop or wonton soup and an egg roll.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons peanut oil</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li> 
        <li>3 tablespoons reduced-sodium teriyaki sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>3 cups cold cooked rice</li>
        <li>⅔ cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
        <li>⅔ cup frozen carrot slices, thawed</li>
        <li>⅔ cup frozen chopped broccoli, thawed</li>
        <li>¼ cup sliced green onion (green part only)</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook egg in hot wok, stirring continually, until no longer moist, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer egg to a plate and return wok to heat.</li>
        <li>Cook ginger and garlic in skillet until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add teriyaki sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, salt, and red pepper flakes to the ginger and garlic; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and continue to cook another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Crumble cold rice into the wok. Stir rice with a wooden spoon, breaking rice into individual grains as it warms; add peas, carrots, broccoli, and green onion. Cook and stir mixture until the vegetables are tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Fold scrambled egg into the rice mixture; cook and stir until egg is reheated, 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
