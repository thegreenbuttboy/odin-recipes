        <li>10 cups vegetable stock</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>2 (3 inch) cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
        <li>2 pods star anise</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Soup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package thin rice noodles (such as Thai Kitchen®)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 (14 ounce) packages firm tofu, drained and cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
        <li>8 ounces enoki mushrooms</li> 
        <li>4 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup coarsely chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 lime, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>2 jalapeno peppers, sliced into rings</li>
        <li>¼ cup mung bean sprouts</li>
        <li>¼ cup Thai basil leaves, torn into bite-size pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place vegetable stock, onion, soy sauce, garlic, cinnamon sticks, ground ginger, star anise, and bay leaves in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until flavors combine, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove solids with a slotted spoon and keep broth hot.</li>
        <li>Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Set aside until noodles are softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly. Divide noodles among 6 serving bowls.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add tofu in a single layer and fry, in batches, until golden brown, about 6 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Simmer fried tofu and mushrooms in broth until heated through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to serving bowls. Top with scallions and cilantro. Ladle in hot broth.</li>
        <li>Serve lime wedges, jalapeno peppers, bean sprouts, and basil alongside for garnishing each bowl.</li>
    </ol>
